## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
The specific packages used in this project mainly are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn for the purposes of data cleaning and manipulation, data visualization and modeling respectively.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. Can the price of an Airbnb listing be predicted to optimize listing price?
2. What factors contribute most significantly to the price of an Airbnb listing?
3. Can we predict the total monthly revenue for an Airbnb listing?
4. What factors contribute most to the total monthly revenue of an Airbnb unit? How do these differ from the nightly price for a unit?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! 

Credit to the Notebook "Seattle Airbnb Exploration" created by kaggle user Kuixi Zhu. A significant amount of code for data cleaning and feature engineering in this project was used from this notebook.
